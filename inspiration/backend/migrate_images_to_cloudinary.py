"""
Migration script to upload existing images from public folder to Cloudinary
with proper naming conventions (ID + name).

This script:
1. Reads all books and users from the database
2. Uploads their existing images to Cloudinary with proper naming
3. Updates the database with Cloudinary public IDs
4. Maintains backward compatibility with existing image paths

Usage:
    conda activate boiAdda
    python migrate_images_to_cloudinary.py
